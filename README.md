In this repository I aim to publish some data science projects which I have conducted. The documentation of these projects is ongoing and currently takes place in following [document (Data_Science_Projects)](https://github.com/MWelHeb/01_Covid19_Scan/blob/main/Data_Science_Projects.md).

As soon as a prototype of a project is ready it will be published. Following projects exist so far:
