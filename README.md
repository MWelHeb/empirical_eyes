In this repository I aim to publish some privately conducted data science projects/exercises. The documentation of these projects is ongoing. 

Currently the following document ["Publishing a data science project"](https://github.com/MWelHeb/01_Covid19_Scan/blob/main/Data_Science_Projects.md) contains a description of a first project related to an exemplary analysis of Covid19 figures. The document aims to stretch the full picture from the starting point of a data science project, i.e. from choosing an appropriate data science software, followed by the data analysis itself which involves data preparation but also presenting the analysis and results through a web application, and finally the topic to make this analysis available to a large audience (potentially anybody world wide) by means of passing the analysis from a local client/computer to a cloud environment. 

As soon as a prototype of any project is ready it will be published. Following projects exist so far:

- [Covid19 Scan](http://18.192.208.203:8501/)
- [Covid19 Scan (including maps)](http://18.192.208.203:8502/)
