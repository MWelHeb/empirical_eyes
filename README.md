# Publishing a data science project

# 1 - Starting point - To have a (data science) question. 
# In my case - at the beginning of the covid crisis - I was very much interested in having an overview on the status of covid19 infections in the various countries at each point in time. My goal was not to rely on any third party reports which I could not modidfy or update according to my interests and needs (e.g. which countries are displayed, which figures are shown, which time comparison is displayed etc.) but to build up a report/analysis which reflected my approach of describing the current covid situation. My basic idea was to somehow scan the typical covid curve of new infections (expecting it to look some how like a bell curve) for each and every country and then to position each country on a "typical generic covid curve" in order to get an overview on one page. 

# Apart from the (data science) question obviously you need to have some relevant data as well a data science software at hand.

# 2 - Data science software
# Having worked in data science over many years I have gained some experience in data science, econometrics and statistics related software such as GAUSS, SAS, SPSS, LIMDEP, R, etc. as well as data handling related languages, e.g. SQL, PHP, Perl, etc.. Python however I had not touched so far and hence looking into some statistics on data science software usage showed me that the usage Python was substantially increasing over the last years. Hence I wanted to get an understanding of Python descided to use Python for this project.

# How to install python in which version and with which modules?
# Which package manager, distribution manager, etc. to use (pip, conda, anaconda etc.)?
# Which development environment/programming editor to use (Jupyter, Spyder, etc.)? 

# 3 - Data source
# Basically in a first step a Google search directed me to the GitHup Datasource: D2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE
