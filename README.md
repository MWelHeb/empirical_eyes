# To have a data science question. 
# In my case - at the beginning of the covid crisis - I was very much interested in having an overview on the status of covid19 infections in the various countries at each point in time. My goal was not to rely on any third party reports which I could not modidfy or update according to my interests and needs (e.g. which countries are displayed, which figures are shown, which time comparison is displayed etc.) but to build up a report/analysis which reflected my approach of describing the current covid situation. My basic idea was to somehow scan the typical covid curve of new infections (expecting it to look some how like a bell curve) for each and every country and the to position each country on a "typical generic covid curve" in order to get an overview on one page. 
# Apart from the data science question obviously you need to have some relevant data as well a data science software at hand.
