In this repository I aim to publish some privately conducted data science projects/exercises. The documentation of these projects is ongoing. As soon as a prototype of any project is ready it will be published. Please note that while the documentations of each project is basically always available I have to excuse for the fact that the corresponding application is sometimes not accessible due to the fact that it is hosted on a cloud server which sometimes has a downtime. Following projects exist so far.

### <a name="id1"></a>1 - Publishing a data science project (Covid19_Scan)
I started of with the document [Publishing a data science project (Covid19_Scan)](https://github.com/MWelHeb/01_Covid19_Scan/blob/main/Data_Science_Projects.md) which is a description of a first project related to an exemplary analysis of Covid19 figures. The document aims to stretch the full picture from the starting point of a data science project, i.e. from choosing an appropriate data science software, followed by the data analysis itself which involves data preparation but also presenting the analysis and results through a web application, and finally the topic of making this analysis available to a large audience (potentially anybody world wide) by means of passing the analysis from a local client/computer to a cloud environment.

### <a name="id1"></a>2 - Analyzing ETF with Python
Next data science area which I was interested in related to the topic of finance. When it comes to investing money many advices center around investments into ETF (i.e. exchange traded funds vs. e.g. single stocks). Therefore, I wanted to get a better understanding on the variety of ETF and their historical developments and any potentially relevant insights which might help when investing into ETF.
